# **“CVE-2020-1472” Zerologon: Full Domain Compromise in 3 Commands**

The **Zerologon vulnerability** (CVE‑2020‑1472) is one of the most severe flaws discovered in Microsoft’s **Netlogon** protocol, impacting all versions of **Windows Server** from **2008 R2** through **2019**. An unauthenticated attacker can impersonate any machine—including the Domain Controller—and obtain **Domain Admin** access in seconds, enabling full AD takeover.

The vulnerability works by exploiting a weakness in how Netlogon handles **authentication between client machines and domain controllers**. Zerologon allows **unauthenticated attackers** to **impersonate any machine in the domain**, including the **Domain Controller**, and gain **Domain Admin** access in a matter of seconds.

What makes **Zerologon** particularly dangerous is that it can be exploited without **prior authentication**, and **no user interaction** is required. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending **crafted packets** over port 445 (SMB), which is widely open on **unpatched servers**.

This attack is so severe that once it is exploited, it grants attackers **full control over the domain**, enabling them to reset passwords, modify accounts, and do anything with the **Active Directory** infrastructure.

---

### **`📌2. Vulnerability Overview`**

**CVE-2020-1472: Zerologon**

The **Netlogon Remote Protocol** (MS-NRPC) facilitates **authentication** and **communication** between clients and **Domain Controllers (DC)** in a Windows domain. This vulnerability lies in the **authentication process**, specifically the **AES-CFB8 encryption algorithm** used by Netlogon.

When a machine joins the domain, it has to establish trust with the Domain Controller (DC) via a process known as **Netlogon authentication**. One of the core operations is the **establishment of a secure channel**. Unfortunately, the algorithm used to encrypt certain authentication messages in the **Netlogon protocol** is weak. An attacker can exploit this weakness to **bypass authentication** entirely and impersonate any machine in the domain, including the Domain Controller.

---

### **`3. Lab Setup (Tools + Env)`**

Here’s how you can set up a test environment to simulate the Zerologon attack:

| **Component** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **OS** | Windows Server 2019 (Unpatched Domain Controller), Windows 10 (Attacker machine) |
| **Tools** | **Impacket**, **Zerologon PoC**, **Mimikatz**, **Metasploit**, **BloodHound** |
| **Attacker Account** | A low-privileged user (does not need any special permissions except access to the network) |
| **Target** | A Windows Server Domain Controller (unpatched or running pre-September 2020 updates) |
| **Network Setup** | Ensure both the attacker and target machine are on the same internal network, or simulate via VPN in a test lab. |
| **Exploitable Vulnerability** | Unpatched or missing Microsoft **security update CVE-2020-1472** |

### Required Tools:

1. **Impacket**: A suite of Python classes to facilitate **network penetration testing**. Used to send and receive crafted packets, simulate Netlogon communication, and execute **Zerologon exploitation**.
2. **Zerologon PoC**: A **proof-of-concept** script specifically designed to exploit CVE-2020-1472. It allows the attacker to easily craft the **Netlogon** packets and bypass authentication.

---

### `**4. Step-by-Step Exploitation**`

Here’s how the attack works in **3 simple commands**:

### `**Step 1: Identify Vulnerable Domain Controllers**`

The first step in exploitation is to identify whether the **Domain Controller** (DC) is vulnerable. You can use **Impacket**'s tool to query the domain and check for any vulnerable systems.

- **Check Netlogon version** and if vulnerable using **Impacket**:

```basic
python3 [GetNPUsers.py](http://getnpusers.py/) -dc-ip <DC_IP> -domain <DOMAIN> -user <USER>
```

If the request is successful, it indicates that the DC is vulnerable to Zerologon.

---

 **`Step 2: Exploit the Zerologon Vulnerability`**

Now that we know the **Domain Controller** is vulnerable, we can exploit the vulnerability.

- **Run Zerologon exploit** using the **PoC (Proof of Concept)** script. This will send specially crafted packets to the Domain Controller, exploiting the weak cryptographic implementation and gaining unauthorized access.

```basic
python3 [zerologon.py](http://zerologon.py/) -target <dc_ip>
```

The PoC script sends a series of **crafted Netlogon messages** that force the Domain Controller to authenticate the attacker without proper validation.

Alternatively, you can use **Impacket's ntlmrelayx** to relay SMB authentication requests:

```basic
python3 [ntlmrelayx.py](http://ntlmrelayx.py/) -t nc://<dc_ip>:445
```

This bypasses the normal authentication process and allows the attacker to impersonate any machine in the domain (including the Domain Controller itself).

---

### **`Step 3: Gain Domain Admin Privileges`**

Once the attacker is able to impersonate the Domain Controller, they can escalate their privileges and take full control of the domain.

- **Dumping credentials with Impacket**:

```basic
python3 [secretsdump.py](http://secretsdump.py/) -target <dc_ip> -user <user> -password <password>
```

This command allows you to extract **hashes and credentials** from the Domain Controller.

- **Use Mimikatz** to escalate privileges and dump passwords:

```basic
mimikatz.exe "privilege::debug" "sekurlsa::logonpasswords"
```

Once you have access to the Domain Admin credentials, you can **change passwords**, **create new admin accounts**, or **reset account passwords**.

---

### `**5. Detection & Blue Team View**`

**Detecting Zerologon** can be challenging because it exploits a **protocol-level vulnerability**, leaving minimal traces. However, there are still **signs** that can help you identify the attack.

### Key **Detection Points**:

1. **Event ID 4625** (Failed Login Attempts):
    - High-frequency login failures from unauthorized users or machines may indicate an exploitation attempt.
2. **Event ID 4771** (Kerberos Pre-authentication Failures):
    - Anomalies in **Kerberos pre-authentication failures** may be a sign that an attacker is trying to bypass authentication via Zerologon.
3. **Netlogon Traffic Analysis**:
    - Abnormal patterns in **Netlogon traffic** (like **unauthorized machine** trying to authenticate as the Domain Controller) can help detect exploitation attempts.
    - You can set up **Network Monitoring Tools** such as **Wireshark** or **Zeek** to capture and analyze Netlogon traffic for anomalies.
4. **Monitor Netlogon-related logs**:
    - Regularly monitor logs such as **Event ID 1200** (Netlogon Connection) and **Event ID 8000** (Netlogon Failure).
    - Any **Netlogon authentication anomalies** such as missing encryption or invalid messages can indicate an exploitation attempt.

### `**6. Patch & Mitigation Tips**`

To prevent exploitation, **patching** is essential. Microsoft released a security patch in **September 2020** for **CVE-2020-1472** to fix this vulnerability.

1. **Apply Patches**: Ensure that **Windows Server** and all systems in your domain have been updated with the latest **security patches** (especially the updates released in **September 2020**).
    - Patch your **Domain Controllers** and **Windows Servers** immediately.
    - You can check for missing updates using **Windows Update** or the **Microsoft Update Catalog**.
2. **Enforce SMB Signing**:
    - SMB Signing can help detect and block unauthenticated SMB traffic.
    - Configure **Group Policy** to **enforce SMB signing** and protect against the **Zerologon exploit**.
3. **Limit Access to Netlogon Services**:
    - **Restrict Netlogon** access to trusted sources and IP ranges. Only allow Domain Controllers and authorized devices to communicate over Netlogon (port 445).
    - Limit access to the **Netlogon Remote Protocol** (RPC) by configuring **firewall rules**.
4. **Monitor Netlogon Traffic**:
    - Set up **network traffic analysis** to detect suspicious traffic patterns associated with **Netlogon authentication**.
    - Use SIEM tools like **Splunk** or **Elastic Stack** to correlate authentication events and monitor for any anomalies.
